# pydefm: Python bindings for defm

This is a python wrapper of the [`barry c++` library][barry-git], and in
particular, of the `defm` module that provides utilities for fitting
discrete exponential family models. This is possible using the
[`pybind11`][] library (which rocks!).

The `defm` module is already
[implemented in R](https://github.com/UofUEpiBio/defm){target="_blank"}

## Installation


- clone this repository
- `pip install ./pydefm`


## CI Examples


There are examples for CI in `.github/workflows`. A simple way to produces
binary "wheels" for all platforms is illustrated in the "wheels.yml" file,
using [`cibuildwheel`][].


Test call
---------

```{python}
import pydefm as m
import numpy as np

y = np.array([0, 10, 3])
x = np.array([1, 2.0, 3.4])
id = np.array([11, 2, 3])

obj = m.new_defm(id, y, x)

# Printing the object on screen shows it is a pointer
obj
```


```{python}
# We can export member functions from the C++ class. Here is
# an example of a function defined in the C++ class:
obj.print()
```

Currently, the C++ code uses `printf` to print to the screen, which is a different buffer from Python (the problem will be solved using [this](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/pycpp/utilities.html?highlight=print#using-python-s-print-function-in-c){target="_blank"}).

```{python}
# Checking if the data is recovered
m.print_y(obj)
```
